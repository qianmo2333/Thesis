    This thesis investigates the problem of collision-free navigation for wheeled mobile robots in complex environments. With the growing demand for autonomous systems capable of safely navigating dynamic and unpredictable settings, more efficient and practical navigation algorithms have been developed. This thesis focuses on one such navigation algorithm—the Sliding Mode Control (SMC)—to test and analyze its principles and evaluate its performance through simulation results to determine its efficiency.
